computer organization and architecture (R-type) Single Cycle Datapath Load and Store Components
We have designed an R format Single Cycle Datapath. The R-type format has two 
source register fields: Rs and Rt, and one destination register field Rd. All register fields are 5-
bit long and address 32 general-purpose registers. The sa field is used as the shift amount for 
shift instructions and the funct field defines the ALU function for R-type instructions
